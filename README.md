# 📰 Blazorise.Articles

This repository contains all **blog** and **news** posts published on the [Blazorise website](https://blazorise.com).

It’s designed to make writing, reviewing, and publishing new content **fast, simple, and collaborative** — all through Markdown files.

---

## ✨ Overview

The Blazorise Blog and News sections are fully powered by Markdown.

Every post (whether a blog or a news update) lives as a simple `.md` file inside one of the two folders:

```
/blog
/news
```

Each post is stored in its own subfolder, named by date and slug, for example:

```
blog/
 └── 2025-10-17-blazorise-blog-reimagined/
     ├── post.md
     └── img/
         └── blazorise-blog-reimagined.png
```

---

## 🧱 Front Matter Format

Each post starts with a YAML front matter section that defines the post’s metadata.

```yaml

## 🖋️ Writing a Post

1. **Create a new folder** under either `/blog` or `/news`

Name it using the date and a short slug:

```
2025-10-17-my-awesome-post
```

2. **Add your post.md** file with YAML front matter and Markdown content.

3. **Add any images** inside an `img` subfolder next to your Markdown file:

```
img/my-post-image.png
```

4. **Use relative paths** for images inside Markdown:

```markdown
![My Post Image](img/my-post-image.png)
```

5. **Create a Pull Request** to propose your post.

The Blazorise team will review, approve, and merge it — triggering the publishing workflow.

---

## ⚙️ Publishing Workflow

When a new post is merged into the `main` branch:

1. A GitHub Action automatically runs.
2. It parses all Markdown posts and metadata.
3. It builds optimized bundles:

- `index.json` → summary info for all posts
- `posts.zip` → full Markdown content
- `version.json` → current build version

4. The Blazorise Docs site automatically refreshes to display the new content.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Contributing Guidelines

- Keep tone consistent with existing articles — friendly and informative.
- Use **plain Markdown** whenever possible (avoid inline HTML unless necessary).
- Optimize images for web (prefer ≤ 200 KB).
- Run spell check before committing.
- Follow the filename convention:

```
yyyy-MM-dd-post-title
```
