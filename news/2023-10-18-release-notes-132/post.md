# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.3.2

Blazorise, your  go-to component library for Blazor, has just released a maintenance update packed with valuable improvements. Let's dive into the key highlights:

## What's New in 1.3.2

### Enhanced Validation

Validation is crucial, and Blazorise now ensures error messages defined on `ValidationError` take top priority. This means users get immediate feedback, making your forms more user-friendly and reliable.

### Safer RichTextEdit

RichTextEdit's JavaScript invocation has been fixed for increased stability. You can trust it to deliver seamless text editing and formatting experiences without unexpected hiccups.

### Autocomplete Fixes

Autocomplete is now more robust, whether for simple text suggestions or complex data selection. Expect a smoother user experience in various scenarios.

### Improved Documentation

Documentation is your guide to Blazorise. With these updates, we made some small adjustments to understand and use the library effectively, reducing your learning curve.

## Commercial Support

Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.
