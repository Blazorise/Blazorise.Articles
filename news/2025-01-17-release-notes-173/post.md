# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.7.3

We're excited to bring you Blazorise 1.7.3, a focused update addressing key issues and delivering important fixes for smoother and more reliable development. This release reflects feedback from the Blazorise community, and we're grateful for your continued support.

## What's New in 1.7.3

### PDF Viewer Landscape PDF is Upside Down

Fixed an issue where landscape-oriented PDFs displayed upside down in the PDF Viewer. The viewer now correctly renders landscape documents in their intended orientation.

### Carousel: Fade Animation Not Working

Fixed a problem where the fade animation for the Carousel component was not working correctly. Animations are now smooth and reliable across all supported themes.

### Video Component for Offline Play

The Video component now supports full offline functionality by bundling the necessary JavaScript library locally instead of downloading it from a CDN. This change ensures the component works seamlessly in offline or restricted network environments.

## Additional Improvements

Along with the major fixes, we have addressed several other bugs and made minor improvements to enhance the overall user experience and functionality of Blazorise. We appreciate your patience and continuous support as we work to make Blazorise better with each update.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.3 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
