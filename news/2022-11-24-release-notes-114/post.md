# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.1.4

We released Blazorise 1.1 just a few monght ago, and like any release, there are few rough edges to iron out which warrant making maintenance "patch" releases.

This new **Blazorise 1.1.4** is a hotfix release to solve this and a few other minor issues that were fixed in the meantime. Blazorise 1.1.4 is a **recommended upgrade for all Blazorise 1.1 and Blazorise 1.1.3 users**.
