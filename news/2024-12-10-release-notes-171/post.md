# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.7.1

We're excited to announce the maintenance release of Blazorise 1.7.1! This release includes several bug fixes, enhancements, and updates to improve your development experience and streamline our documentation process.

## What's New in 1.7.1

### Support for Components Without a Parameterless Constructor

Previously, components in Blazor typically required a parameterless constructor due to limitations in the way the framework initializes and instantiates components. With this update, Blazorise now supports scenarios where components rely on constructors with parameters, enabling advanced use cases such as Dependency Injection.

### Documentation Improvements

In this release, we've updated all references to static files, such as stylesheets and scripts, to include query versioning. This change improves caching behavior and ensures that the correct versions of static assets are always loaded in your applications.

This improvement is particularly beneficial for production environments where browser caching can lead to unexpected behavior when static files are updated. With query versioning, you get the peace of mind that your app always uses the right resources.

### Automated API Documentation

We've introduced automation for generating and maintaining Blazorise API documentation, a significant step toward ensuring developers always have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information.

**Real-Time Accuracy**: With automation, API documentation reflects the current state of the Blazorise codebase, minimizing outdated or incorrect information.

**Reduced Maintenance Overhead**: Automated tools streamline the process of generating and updating documentation, allowing the Blazorise team to focus on feature development and bug fixes.

**Comprehensive Coverage** By integrating automation, we've expanded the API documentation to include edge cases, advanced configurations, and lesser-known methods or parameters that were previously undocumented.

The new automated system leverages Blazorise's metadata and code annotations to create robust API documentation that integrates seamlessly into the existing docs platform. This ensures that as the framework evolves, developers can rely on trustworthy and comprehensive documentation.

## Additional Improvements

Along with the major fixes, we have addressed several other bugs and made minor improvements to enhance the overall user experience and functionality of Blazorise. We appreciate your patience and continuous support as we work to make Blazorise better with each update.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.1 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
