# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.7.5

Blazorise 1.7.5 is a maintenance release focusing on bug fixes and refinements to improve stability and functionality across various components.

This release addresses key issues related to the DataGrid, Markdown, Video, and Navbar (BarToggler) components, ensuring a smoother development experience. Notable improvements include enhanced Markdown file upload handling, better DataGrid cell focus behavior, and fixes for the Seeking event in the Video component. Additionally, several UI inconsistencies affecting FluentUI, Tailwind, and Bulma frameworks have been resolved. Read on for the full list of changes.

## Key Highlights in 1.7.5

Managing uploaded files in the Markdown component is now more efficient. With the newly merged uploaded files callback, developers can seamlessly process multiple file uploads without unnecessary complexities. This change enhances the Markdown editing experience by reducing errors and improving user workflow.

A long-standing issue in the DataGrid where cancelling a cell edit would not restore focus has been fixed. Now, when a user cancels an edit, the focus properly returns to the relevant cell, ensuring a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction.

## Fix for Video Component Seeking Event

The Seeking event in the Video component was previously unreliable, leading to issues when users attempted to scrub through video content. This has been fixed, allowing seamless seeking behavior and better control over video playback.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.5 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
