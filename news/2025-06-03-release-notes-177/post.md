# üê£ Blazorise 1.7.7 ‚Äì Maintenance Release

We're happy to announce the release of Blazorise 1.7.7, a maintenance update that brings important bug fixes and enhancements to ensure a smoother and more stable experience for developers using Blazorise.

While this is a smaller release focused primarily on maintenance, it includes several impactful improvements across components like Video, DataGrid, Check, Autocomplete, and more.

## Key Highlights in 1.7.7

### Video: Bundle JS and CSS as a Single File

Blazorise Video now supports bundling its JavaScript and CSS files into a single file. This enhancement reduces the number of HTTP requests and simplifies deployment. It's especially useful for scenarios where minimizing asset requests is critical.

### DataGrid: Fix OldItem in RowUpdated Callback

We've fixed a long-standing issue where the OldItem in the RowUpdated event was not correctly populated. This fix helps developers compare the updated values with the original ones more reliably.

## DataGrid: Numeric Filters Now Work with 0 in Non-Nullable Types

A bug where numeric filters didn't work correctly when filtering for 0 values in non-nullable fields has been resolved. Now you can expect accurate filtering behavior across all numeric types.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.7 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
