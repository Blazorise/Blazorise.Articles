# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.7.2

The Blazorise team is excited to announce the release of version 1.7.2, featuring a series of important bug fixes and improvements to enhance the stability, usability, and performance of the framework. This update addresses critical issues reported by the community and ensures a more seamless experience for developers building modern web applications with Blazorise.

## What's New in 1.7.2

### Documentation Improvements

Fixed an issue in the documentation where certain component names were incorrectly displayed or referenced. This ensures better accuracy and usability for developers referencing the documentation.

### Improved Table Resizing

Addressed multiple issues with table resizing and the Resizable feature to enhance functionality and compatibility:

- Fixed an issue where table resizing did not work in responsive mode, ensuring seamless adjustments across various screen sizes.
- Resolved compatibility problems with the Resizable feature when using the Bootstrap 5 provider, ensuring consistent behavior across supported frameworks.
- Improved column resizing behavior to prevent neighboring columns from shrinking improperly and added horizontal scrollbar visibility for better usability in wide tables. These updates collectively provide a smoother and more reliable resizing experience for developers and end-users alike.

### NumericPicker Alignment

Fixed a visual misalignment issue with the NumericPicker component that caused elements to appear out of place. This update restores proper alignment across supported themes for a cleaner user interface.

## Additional Improvements

Along with the major fixes, we have addressed several other bugs and made minor improvements to enhance the overall user experience and functionality of Blazorise. We appreciate your patience and continuous support as we work to make Blazorise better with each update.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.2 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.
