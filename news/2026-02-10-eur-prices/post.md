## Completing the Transition to EUR-Based Pricing

We're announcing the next step in the evolution of Blazorise pricing.

Last year, we transitioned Blazorise pricing from USD to EUR to reflect our position as a European-based company headquartered in Croatia and to comply with EU pricing regulations. Since then, all **new subscriptions** have been billed using EUR-based pricing.

Today, we're completing that transition by aligning **existing USD-based subscriptions** with our EUR pricing model.

---

## What Is Changing

- Existing subscriptions currently billed in USD will transition to **EUR-based pricing at renewal**
- No subscriptions will be changed mid-billing cycle
- Plan features, limits, and support levels remain unchanged

At renewal, subscriptions will be billed using the applicable **EUR list price** for the selected plan. Payments will continue to be processed in your local currency based on current exchange rates, as handled by our payment provider.

---

## Why We're Making This Change

Blazorise pricing is defined in EUR, which is also the currency in which we operate and incur costs, including development, support, and infrastructure.

Maintaining a mix of USD and EUR-based subscriptions has increasingly exposed us to currency volatility and created inconsistencies across our pricing model. Aligning all subscriptions to EUR allows us to:

- Maintain **consistent and transparent pricing**
- Reduce exposure to **currency fluctuations**
- Simplify billing and long-term planning
- Sustain continued investment in Blazorise development and support

---

## Will This Affect My Renewal Price?

Our published plan prices remain unchanged and continue to be defined in EUR.

However, customers previously billed in USD may see a difference in the amount charged at renewal due to currency exchange rate differences. Any such change reflects the conversion from USD-based billing to our EUR pricing model, not a change in plan level, features, or terms.

---

## When Does This Take Effect?

This change will take effect on **March 1, 2026**, at the time of your next subscription renewal. Existing USD-based subscriptions will automatically transition to EUR pricing upon renewal.

We recommend reviewing your subscription details ahead of renewal to avoid any surprises.
