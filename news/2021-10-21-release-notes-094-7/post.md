## Support

Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia, maintains the open-source component library Blazorise. We strongly believe in the open-source ecosystem, so we're giving it away for free through our Blazorise Community licenses.

If you want to help the project and are already a part of a large organization, please consider purchasing a commercial license to help us become a sustainable business. Then we'll be able to continue working on Blazorise.

With a commercial license, you get premium forum support as well as access to our private repositories and community-licensed themes. To learn more, visit us at [Blazorise Commercial](commercial).
