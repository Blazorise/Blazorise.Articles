# üê£ Blazorise 1.7.6 ‚Äì Maintenance Release

We're excited to roll out **Blazorise 1.7.6** just in time for the Easter holidays! This maintenance release brings a range of stability fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and some meaningful updates to the documentation experience. Whether you're planning to take a well-deserved break or push through some last-minute feature updates, this release is here to make things smoother.

## Key Highlights in 1.7.6

### DataGrid: Missing Columns on Null First Row

We fixed a frustrating bug where DataGrid wouldn't generate columns if the first row in the data source contained null values. The improved logic now evaluates the full data set, ensuring reliable and complete column rendering.

### Chart: Crash with Zoom Plugin

Using the Chart component with the zoom plugin could previously result in runtime exceptions. That issue has been resolved, making zooming safe and functional again across all chart types.

## FileEdit: AOT Compilation Fix

A critical fix addresses a `NotSupportedException` thrown by FileEdit when used in AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compiled environments. It now works properly under AOT, making it safe to use in trimmed and precompiled deployments.

We encourage you to update to version 1.7.6 to benefit from these fixes and improvements. As always, please report any issues or provide feedback to help us continue improving.

## Documentation Improvements

We've made a big push to improve documentation usability and search functionality. The component search on the documentation site now returns richer and more relevant results, including:

Component names

Parameters and attributes

Methods and event handlers

These updates make it easier to find exactly what you need, whether you're browsing by keyword or looking up how a specific feature works.
