# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.3.1

We hope you’ve been having a great experience building with Blazorise 1.3. Today, we’re pleased to announce the maintenance release of version 1.3.1, which brings some crucial bug fixes and documentation enhancements.

## What's New in 1.3.1

### Validation System Fix

The primary motivation behind this release is to address a bug that some of our users reported in the validation system. A small group of developers faced intermittent validation issues, where validations would sometimes not work as expected.

We take such reports seriously and prioritize user experience above all else. We're glad to inform you that the bug has been resolved. You can now expect a smoother and more reliable validation experience when using Blazorise.

### Documentation Improvements

Your feedback is invaluable. Based on your input and our ongoing commitment to clarity, we've made some tweaks to the documentation. These updates should provide clearer guidance and enable developers to get up and running faster with Blazorise. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, we believe you'll find these enhancements beneficial.

## Feedback

Your feedback and contributions are what make the Blazorise community thrive. Please continue sharing your experiences, bug reports, and feature requests. Every input helps shape Blazorise for the better.

## Known incompatibilities

As of now, there are no known incompatibilities with the previous Blazorise 1.3.x releases. We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.3.1.

If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading to 1.3.1, please file an issue on GitHub.

## Commercial Support

Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.

With a commercial license, you will have access to premium forum support, private repositories and community-licensed themes. To learn more about commercial licenses, please visit our website at Blazorise Commercial.
