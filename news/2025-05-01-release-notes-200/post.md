## Key Blazorise 1.0 Highlights üí°

## Migration Notes üõ†

A few API changes and behavior updates have been introduced in Blazorise 2.0 to improve consistency and functionality. Here‚Äôs a summary:

## New Features & Enhancements üöÄ

You may now allow multiple values to be selected in the DataGridSelectColumn. Set the new Multiple parameter to true to enable this feature. Please bind the corresponding array to successfully bind the multiple values.

A new DataGrid utility, the ExpressionCompiler was introduced. 
    This utility allows you to compile expressions and use them in the DataGrid. 
    The ExpressionCompiler can be used together with the DataGridColumnInfo collection provided by the ReadData in order to create Expression based queries (IQueryables) that can in turn be used in ORMs like Entity Framework.

    Visit DataGrid Binding Large Data for more information.

## Final Notes

As always, your feedback is invaluable in guiding future Blazorise development. We encourage you to try out the new features and let us know your thoughts. Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for Blazorise, and we look forward to bringing you even more enhancements in future updates!
