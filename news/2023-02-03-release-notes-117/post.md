# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.1.7

With the successful launch of 1.2, we're shifting our focus to the support branch. This maintenance release addresses a number of issues present in the 1.1.x branch, aimed at helping those still using it make the transition to the newest version, 1.2.

For a detailed overview of the changes that 1.1.7 included and which are also part of this new release, please read the [1.1 support notes](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/4147).

## Changes

Here are the main changes since 1.1.5-stable:

- [#4481](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/4481): Blazorise 1.1.6 Datagrid not refreshing
- [#4524](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/4524): Font awesome icon
- [#4536](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/4536): NumericEdit with Min and Max doesn't work
- [#4543](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/4543): Autocomplete component duplication check

## Known incompatibilities

As of now, there are no known incompatibilities with the previous Blazorise 1.1.x releases. We encourage all users to upgrade to 1.1.7.

If you experience any unexpected behavior change in your projects after upgrading to 1.1.7, please [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues).

## Support

Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.

With a commercial license, you will have access to premium forum support, private repositories and community-licensed themes. To learn more about commercial licenses, please visit our website at [Blazorise Commercial](https://blazorise.com/commercial).
