# v0.9.4 - patch 2 release notes

This patch release brings more bug fixes than usual. Which makes sense considering how many changes we introduced with v0.9.4 release.

The most nasty bug was with the DataGrid edit mode where it would raise an exception if you had any nested field as a complex object. But David was quick to investigate and issue a fix along with more unit tests so that it doesn't repeat in the future.

In any case, Blazorise should be much stable now so just grab new NuGets and update your projects ðŸ’ª
