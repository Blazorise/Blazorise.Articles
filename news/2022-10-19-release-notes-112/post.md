# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.1.2

We released Blazorise 1.1.1 just a few weeks ago with a small array of bug fixes, but those nasty bugs are always lurking.

This new Blazorise 1.1.2 is a hotfix release to solve this and a few other minor issues that were fixed in the meantime. Blazorise 1.1.1 is a recommended upgrade for all Blazorise 1.1 and Blazorise 1.1.1 users.
