## Support

Blazorise is an open-source component library maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization located in Croatia, EU. We strongly believe in the open-source ecosystem, and so we're giving it to a community under our Blazorise Community licenses for free.

If you'd like to support the project and are already a part of a large organization, we would like you to consider purchasing a commercial license to help us be a sustainable business. Then, we will be able to continue working on Blazorise.

With a Blazorise commercial license, you get premium forum support and access to our private repositories and themes with a community license. Visit us at [Blazorise Commercial](commercial) to learn more.
