# Maintenance release: Blazorise 1.4.1

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.4.1, which includes important bug fixes and enhancements. This release focuses on improving stability and addressing key issues identified by our user community.

## What's New in 1.4.1

### Fix for Invalid Filename in inputmask.js

Corrected the script reference for inputmask.js to fix loading errors caused by an invalid filename.

### TimePicker Default Display Value Null

Modified the TimePicker component to provide a more intuitive default display, addressing the issue of it showing a Null value initially.

Enhanced the DataGridColumn's type detection to accurately recognize and handle various numeric types, resolving the issue of incorrect value type determination.

## Commercial Support

Blazorise, an open-source component library, is maintained by Megabit Ltd, a small organization based in Croatia. We are strong advocates of the open-source ecosystem, which is why we offer Blazorise through our Community licenses at no cost. However, if you are part of a large organization and would like to support the project, we suggest purchasing a commercial license to help us maintain a sustainable business. This will enable us to continue developing Blazorise.

With a commercial license, you will have access to premium forum support, private repositories and community-licensed themes. To learn more about commercial licenses, please visit our website at Blazorise Commercial.
