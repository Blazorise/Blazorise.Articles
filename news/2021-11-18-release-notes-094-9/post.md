# v0.9.4 - patch 9 release notes

In this release we fixed the bug with Chart serialization introduced with the latest .NET 6.

    to the latest [0.9.5 release](news/release-notes/095).

## Change Log

- [#3116](https://github.com/Megabit/Blazorise/issues/3116): Charts `JsonNumberHandlingAttribute`
